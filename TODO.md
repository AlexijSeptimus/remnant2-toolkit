# TODO

- On the builder, add info icon to click/hover to see item info for each item in the build.
  - Look into also having an export detailed version that shows images, descriptions, stats, etc.
- Add duplicate build button to builds in profile
- Added community build page where you can search and sort builds
- Add mechanism to vote for builds (upvote only)
- On tracker, allowing sorting alphabetically or by item type (i.e. group armors together)
- On item lookup, add expanded filters
- Add CSV import
- Add toggle to limit build items to DLC/non-DLC items

## Bugs

- If you add a skill, the skills for that class should not be selectable in the other skill slot

## Later TODO

- Replace fextralife wiki links with remnant.wiki
