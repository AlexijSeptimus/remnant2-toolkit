# TODO

- Detailed build cards should open info when clicking item name
- Add pagination to build tables in profile page.
- Add build randomizer for the luls
- Add duplicate build button to builds in profile
- Added community build page where you can search and sort builds
- On tracker, allowing sorting alphabetically or by item type (i.e. group armors together)
- On item lookup, add expanded filters
- Add CSV import
- Add toggle to limit build items to DLC/non-DLC items
- When logging in, the next-auth page to select Discord or Reddit is pretty ugly. Make Reddit Button orange with icon, etc.
- Hide Export Buttons on builder until at least one item in build

## Bugs
