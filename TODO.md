# TODO

- Add toggle to limit build items to DLC/non-DLC items
- Replace fextralife wiki links with remnant.wiki
- Export to image relies on `html2canvas`, which will screenshot an element as is. This means mobile screenshots are very small.
  would ge great to have the dom element expand to desktop size just for the screenshot then size back.
- Add scroll to top button for mobile
- On tracker, allowing sorting alphabetically or by item type (i.e. group armors together)
- Add CSV import
- Add filters to featured builds, anticipating more build submissions!
- Add a way to submit builds directly through the site

## Bugs

## Maybe TODO

- When exporting build, put each weapon and mod next to each other?
  - Same with archtypes?
