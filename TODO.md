## Bugs

- Check stamina calculation. Bolt Jamison Sporebloom build should be 106 stamina total, but is showing 100.6. Replace image once done.
- When creating a build hide "build created by"
- Possible for the date to be formatted for local time considerations, or at least show yyyy-mm-dd?
- Item tracker shows NAN% next to item categories when searching for items, such as when searching for a specific pistol
- If you add a skill, the skills for that class should not be selectable in the other skill slot
- Modal overlay allows click events through. This appears to be a bug in headlessui. See: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/headlessui/issues/1551

## After next patch

- Update Anguish image and description

## Later TODO

- Replace fextralife wiki links with remnant.wiki
