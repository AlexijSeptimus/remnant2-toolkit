# TODO

- Added community build page where you can search and sort builds
- Add mechanism to vote for builds (upvote only)
- On tracker, allowing sorting alphabetically or by item type (i.e. group armors together)
- On item lookup, add expanded filters
- Add CSV import

## Bugs

- If you add a skill, the skills for that class should not be selectable in the other skill slot

## Later TODO
