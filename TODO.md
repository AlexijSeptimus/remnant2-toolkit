# TODO

- On Item Tracker, split weapons into the three types
- Convert profile build tables to cards for better mobile experience.
- Add pagination to build tables in profile page.
- Added community build page where you can search and sort builds
- On tracker, allowing sorting alphabetically or by item type (i.e. group armors together)
- Add CSV import
- Should be able to store tracked items in db
- When logging in, the next-auth page to select Discord or Reddit is pretty ugly. Make Reddit Button orange with icon, etc.
- Add function to highlight description text for terms like burning, bleeding, overloaded, etc.

## Bugs

- If you add a skill, the skills for that class should not be selectable in the other skill slot
- Modal overlay allows click events through. This appears to be a bug in headlessui. See: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/headlessui/issues/1551

## Later TODO

- Replace fextralife wiki links with remnant.wiki
