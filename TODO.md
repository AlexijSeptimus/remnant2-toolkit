# Profiles todo

- Create a route in profiles for the userId slug to view a user's profile
- Ensure only public builds show up
- Allow user to add intro text to their profile
- Allow user to pin X number of builds to the top of their profile

# TODO

- Add profile pages where you can see all builds by a user
- Add a creator builds page to show all creator builds, similar to former featured builds page
- Add info on getting a yellow border around builds
- Add build filters to show only builds above certain vote thresholds
- On tracker, allowing sorting alphabetically or by item type (i.e. group armors together)
- Add CSV import

## Bugs

- Possible for the date to be formatted for local time considerations, or at least show yyyy-mm-dd?
- Item tracker shows NAN% next to item categories when searching for items, such as when searching for a specific pistol
- If you add a skill, the skills for that class should not be selectable in the other skill slot
- Modal overlay allows click events through. This appears to be a bug in headlessui. See: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/headlessui/issues/1551

## After next patch

- Update Anguish image and description

## Later TODO

- Replace fextralife wiki links with remnant.wiki
