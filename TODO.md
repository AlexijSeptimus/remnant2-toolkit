# TODO

- Rename support/medic/summoner build to root doctor (duh)
- Add filters to featured builds, anticipating more build submissions!
- Add a way to submit builds directly through the site
- Check the ingame name of Ranged Crit Chance relic fragment and update data name accordingly

## Bugs

## Maybe TODO

- When exporting build, put each weapon and mod next to each other?
  - Same with archtypes?
