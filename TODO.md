# TODO

- Make armour weight tooltip account for https://remnant2.wiki.fextralife.com/Powerlifter
- Have stat tooltips show the items contributing to the calculations
- Add a way to track items on a second character
- Rework the item import on the tracker to be a bit more clear
- Add tracker of world bosses
- Allow tracking of whether you have completely upgraded a weapon, trait, or archtype
- Add total votes to /created-builds and /favorited-builds
- Add info on getting a yellow border around builds
- Add build filters to show only builds above certain vote thresholds
- On tracker, allowing sorting alphabetically or by item type (i.e. group armors together)
- Add CSV import to tracker
- Make random builds work with only owned items?

## Bugs

- On favorite builds in profile, I don't think sort by date favorited is working
- Item tracker shows NAN% next to item categories when searching for items, such as when searching for a specific pistol
- If you add a skill, the skills for that class should not be selectable in the other skill slot
- Modal overlay allows click events through. This appears to be a bug in headlessui. See: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/headlessui/issues/1551

## After next patch

- Update Anguish image and description

## Later TODO

- Replace fextralife wiki links with remnant.wiki
