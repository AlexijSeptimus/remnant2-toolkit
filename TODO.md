# Where I'm at

- Ensure all passives show up in the item lookup
- Ensure builds still save
- Ensure perks are added to item filters when finding builds

# TODO

- Add build filters to show only builds above certain vote thresholds
- Add build filters to search by classes
- Add creator builds page
- On tracker, allowing sorting alphabetically or by item type (i.e. group armors together)
- Add CSV import
- When logging in, the next-auth page to select Discord or Reddit is pretty ugly. Make Reddit Button orange with icon, etc.
- Add function to highlight description text for terms like burning, bleeding, overloaded, etc.

## Bugs

- Item tracker shows NAN% next to item categories when searching for items, such as when searching for a specific pistol
- If you add a skill, the skills for that class should not be selectable in the other skill slot
- Modal overlay allows click events through. This appears to be a bug in headlessui. See: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/headlessui/issues/1551

## After next patch

- Update Anguish image and description

## Later TODO

- Replace fextralife wiki links with remnant.wiki
