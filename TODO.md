# TODO

- Add build filters to show only builds above certain vote thresholds
- On tracker, allowing sorting alphabetically or by item type (i.e. group armors together)
- Add CSV import
- Add function to highlight description text for terms like burning, bleeding, overloaded, etc.

## Bugs

- Item tracker shows NAN% next to item categories when searching for items, such as when searching for a specific pistol
- If you add a skill, the skills for that class should not be selectable in the other skill slot
- Modal overlay allows click events through. This appears to be a bug in headlessui. See: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/headlessui/issues/1551

## After next patch

- Update Anguish image and description

## Later TODO

- Replace fextralife wiki links with remnant.wiki
