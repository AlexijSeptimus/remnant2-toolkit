# How to use World Saves

## Introduction

These world saves provide a way to quickly fight apocalpyse bosses with specific affixes. Please read below carefully to understand how to use them.

## Before you begin

This feature is intended for people who know what they're doing. If you're not comfortable with the idea of replacing your save files, you should not proceed.

## Locating your save file folder

### Steam

Your Steam folder is located in the following directory, with your own username replacing `_your_username_` and your Steam ID replacing `_steam_id_`:

`C:\Users\_your_username_\Saved Games\Remnant2\Steam\_steam_id_\profile.sav`

### Xbox Game Pass

This is a bit more complicated, but doable. I'd recommend following [this Reddit thread by SpectralHunt](https://www.reddit.com/r/remnantgame/comments/187rfdq/transferring_save_files_from_pcsteam_to_xbox/)

## How world saves are named

There are four world save files in the folder, which correspond to each character slot. To change the world save for your 1st character slot, you'd replace `save_0.sav`. To replace your 5th character slot, you'd replace `save_4.sav`.

## Back up your existing world save

With that in mind, before installing a new world save, copy and paste your existing save to a safe location.

## Installing a new world save

### Back up your existing world save

I mean it! Follow the above instructions to back up your existing world save first!

### Install the downloaded world save

1. BACK UP YOUR EXISTING WORLD SAVE
2. Delete the `save_X.sav` file for the corresponding character slot you want to use.
3. Rename the downloaded world save to `save_X.sav`, replacing `X` with the character slot you want to use.
4. Copy and paste the downloaded world save into the folder.

## Troubleshooting
