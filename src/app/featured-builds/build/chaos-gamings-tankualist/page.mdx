# CHAOS GAMING'S TANKUALIST

[View/Edit Detailed Build on Remnant 2 Toolkit](https://www.remnant2toolkit.com/builder/clr48ewb80000bi6o65pxehdc)

> The "Tankualist" is a build for players who want to play in the fields of the risky Ritualist play-style but with the amazing survivability of the Medic-Misty Step Combo. You have to try this one!
>
> This build has it all: the best dodge mechanic in the game (misty step), insane healing, insane status damage, crazy ad-clear potential and great total DR.
