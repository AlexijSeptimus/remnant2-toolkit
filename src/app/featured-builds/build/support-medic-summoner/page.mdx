> This build is designed to keep you and your allies while also dealing damage to enemies. It's a great build for solo play and co-op.
>
> Be sure to always keep a relic up to keep healing you and allies. Due to the Medic, you will keep refilling relic charges from the damage. The heavy
> weight is not a concern thanks to the Misty Step provided by the Red Doe Amulet and the Ring of Omens.
