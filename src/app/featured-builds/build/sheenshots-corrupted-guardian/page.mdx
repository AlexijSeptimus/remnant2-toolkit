# SheenShots' Corrupted Guardian Build

[View/Edit Detailed Build on Remnant 2 Toolkit](https://www.remnant2toolkit.com/builder/clqxctdb30000vnqmstcmxyyc)

> Corrupted weapons can make some REALLY COOL Builds In Remnant 2. At first, they don't really seem worth the effort, but after some more use, you can actually make them become solid damage dealers. The two best-corrupted weapons by miles are the aphelion and meridian. And this build makes use of both to nuke the world. Corrupted Meridian as it turns out is the best explosive weapon we have available when it comes to crit. So being able to use it constantly is really strong.
